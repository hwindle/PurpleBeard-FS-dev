  <h1>Higher Order Functions in JavaScript</h1>

  <h2>What are higher order functions?</h2>
  <p>Functions that take in other functions as arguments, and/or functions that return functions.</p>

  <h3>array.forEach</h3>
  <p>This changes the original array you are working on, in other words it mutates state.</p>
  <p>This could be used when changing data types in place, for example changing strings into<br />
  numbers or breaking up long numbers into digits.</p>

  <h3>Map</h3>
  <p>One key difference between map and forEach is that map returns a new array and <br />leaves the original array. <br />Unlike array.forEach, you can also chain map and other JavaScript methods together, using a dot. <br />It doesn't mutate state, changing the original array can sometimes lead to bugs. <br />Map could be used with an array of DOM (document object model) elements from
a web page. <br />Each element could then have styles or HTML attributes applied to it and it would be easier to write that way.</p>

<!-- `code`

  <h3>Filter</h3>
  <p>Used to validate and check each element of an array, by using an if condition<br />
  without having to write an if statement. Useful for unchecked user inputs or<br />
  parsing other data from an unknown source. This could also be used to check<br />
  arrays of objects for properties or for whether that object is an instance of a certain class.</p>

  <h3>Reduce</h3>
  <p>Useful for summing an entire array or performing a mathematical <br />operation and accumulating that result. Reduces the array to one value.</p>
